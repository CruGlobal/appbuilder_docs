## Installing Docker

1. Create a docker account at https://www.docker.com/
1. Install docker client for your OS
   - [Linux (Ubuntu-based distributions) use docker’s repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
   - [Windows (using WSL2)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)
   - [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
1. Create a docker swarm:
   ```bash
   docker swarm init --advertise-addr {my.ip.addr.ess}
   ```

**NOTE:** Some useful docker commands:

```bash
docker stack deploy -C {file} {stack}
docker stack remove {stack}
docker ps
docker stats
docker stack ls
docker container ls
docker network ls
docker volume ls
docker images
docker image pull
docker system prune
```

## Installing node.js and NPM

It is recommended to use a node version manager to install node.js & npm. Two well- known version managers are [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#node-version-manager---) and [n](https://github.com/tj/n#n--interactively-manage-your-nodejs-versions). These managers allow you to install multiple versions of node/npm, to switch between them easily, and to avoid “global installs” (which would necessitate sudo/root access).

### Linux, Mac:

First, run the nvm install script from the link above (curl or wget). Afterward, you may have to configure your current shell environment:

```bash
bash source ~/.bashrc
```

Execute the following command, to install both node and npm:

```bash
nvm install node
```

Alternatives (nodesource) to using a node version manager:

[Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Windows:

[Set up your Node.js development environment with WSL 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2)

Verify correct installation using the following commands:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Install the AppBuilder Installer (ab-cli)

The ab-cli tool is the primary tool that creates either a production instance, or a developer install of the AppBuilder. Install the installer using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g Hiro-Nakamura/ab-cli
```

Then, run the installer. Specify your own target directory in place of `{install_dir}`, for example:

```bash
appbuilder install {install_dir} --develop --V1
```

**Option Definitions**

- `--develop`: executes git clone commands to bring down the source code
- `--V1`: this refers to the version of AppBuilder that is currently being used as of March 2021

**Recommended Settings**

```plaintext
port for AppBuilder to listen on: 1337
expose the DB:                    y
DB listening port:                3306
DB root password:                 r00t
Arango root password:             r00t
expose Arango DB:                 y
Arango port:                      8529
encrypt DB tables:                n
use nginx as proxy server:        n
SSL encryption:                   No SSL encryption
SMTP enable:                      n
SMTP authorization:               plain
```

On successful completion of the installer, it should end with the following message:

```bash
To start the system:
   $ cd {install_dir}
   $ npm run up
```

In the working directory, be sure to install npm modules

```bash
cd {install_dir}
npm install
```

After this, you can start the AppBuilder stack..

## Starting AppBuilder

To start the AppBuilder stack:

```bash
cd {install_dir}
./UP.sh
```

When you see the following screen, it means that the AppBuilder stack has successfully loaded.

Open Google Chrome and go to the following URL:

[`http://127.0.0.1:1337`](http://127.0.0.1:1337)

## Additional Information

If using `--develop flag`, the various code repositories will be located at: `{install_dir}/developer/`

To monitor and publish code changes automatically:

```bash
cd {install_dir}/developer/app_builder
npm run watch
```

## Files That You Should Know About

Docker production environment configuration file: `{install_dir}/docker-compose.yml`

Docker development environment configuration file: `{install_dir}/docker-compose.dev.yml`

Convenient helper - bring up all AppBuilder Docker services: `{install_dir}/UP.sh`

Convenient helper - shut down all AppBuilder Docker services: `{install_dir}/Down.sh`

Convenient helper - restart a single AppBuilder Docker service: `{install_dir}/restart.sh {docker_service_name}`

Convenient helper - enter a docker shell session: `{install_dir}/cli.sh`
